            <h2>Kling AI 2.6 Goes Viral with "Motion Control" and Unified Editing</h2>
            <p class="date">January 20, 2026</p>

            <h3>The News</h3>
            <p>Kling AI has released Video 2.6, featuring a "Motion Control" system that has quickly taken over social media. This feature allows a user to upload a static photo of a person and a reference video of a specific movement (like a dance or a complex gesture); the AI then "maps" the motion of the video onto the person in the photo with near-perfect physics.</p>

            <h3>The Details</h3>
            <p>Beyond the viral dance clips, Kling 2.6 introduces prompt-based post-production. For the first time, users can type instructions like "remove the bystanders in the background" or "change the time of day to sunset" directly into the video editor. The model understands the 3D space of the video and modifies the lighting and objects without needing to re-render the entire scene.</p>

            <h3>My Take</h3>
            <p>We are seeing the beginning of the “AI Director” interface. Instead of rolling the dice on a new prompt, creators can surgically edit existing content. The rise of Kling shows that people want tools for editing, not creation.</p>
