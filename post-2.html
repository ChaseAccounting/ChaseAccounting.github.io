            <h2>Google Veo 3.1 Targets YouTube Shorts with Native Vertical Video</h2>
            <p class="date">January 20, 2026</p>

            <p>Just this week, Google announced <strong>Veo 3.1</strong>, an update specifically optimized for the mobile-first creator. The update introduces native support for the 9:16 aspect ratio, allowing creators to generate high-quality vertical content for YouTube Shorts and TikTok without the quality loss associated with cropping landscape footage.</p>

            <h3>The Details: Identity and Style Consistency</h3>
            <p>A standout feature is the improved "Ingredients to Video" workflow. Users can now upload a "reference character" (a still photo of a person or mascot) and a "reference style," and Veo 3.1 will generate a video that maintains that specific identity across different settings. This effectively solves the "character consistency" problem that has plagued AI creators for years.</p>

            <h3>The "Accounting" Take</h3>
            <p>By integrating Veo 3.1 into the YouTube Create app, Google makes professional-grade AI video available to millions of casual creators. The “Ingredients to Video” feature is a game changer for brands who want to scale influencer marketing; corporate departments can now easily insert a brand mascot or a consistent digital spokesperson into an infinite number of training and compliance situations.</p>

                "Maintaining brand identity across AI-generated scenes is the key to moving these tools into professional corporate workflows."
