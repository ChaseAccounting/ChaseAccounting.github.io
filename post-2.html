            <h2>Google Veo 3.1 Targets YouTube Shorts with Native Vertical Video</h2>
            <p class="date">January 20, 2026</p>

            <p>Google has officially announced <strong>Veo 3.1</strong>, a major update designed for the mobile-first creator. While much of the hype is around entertainment, the ability to generate native vertical video (9:16 aspect ratio) has significant implications for corporate social media and marketing workflows.</p>

            <h3>The Breakthrough: "Ingredients to Video"</h3>
            <p>The most notable feature for corporate users is the "Ingredients to Video" workflow. This allows creators to upload a "reference character"—such as a company mascot or a specific employee—and a "reference style." Veo 3.1 then maintains that identity across different settings, finally solving the "character consistency" problem that has previously limited AI video usage in professional branding.</p>

            <h3>The "Accounting" Take</h3>
            <p>From a documentation and internal communications standpoint, this tool allows large organizations to scale their "influencer-style" internal marketing. For example, a finance department could use a consistent digital "guide" to walk employees through new compliance procedures or expense reporting software in a short, vertical format that is easy to consume on mobile devices.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                "The ability to maintain brand identity across an infinite number of situations is a game changer for scaling professional-grade content."
            </blockquote>

            <p>By integrating this into the YouTube Create app, Google is making professional-grade AI video accessible to casual creators and corporate staff alike, bypassing the need for expensive external production for simple internal announcements.</p>
