            <h2>Google Veo 3.1 Targets YouTube Shorts with Native Vertical Video</h2>
            <p class="date">January 20, 2026</p>

            <p>Just this week, Google announced Veo 3.1, specifically optimized for the mobile-first creator. The update introduces native support for the 9:16 aspect ratio, allowing creators to generate high-quality vertical content for YouTube Shorts and TikTok without the quality loss associated with cropping landscape footage.</p>

            <h3>The Details</h3>
            <p>A standout feature is the improved "Ingredients to Video" workflow. Users can now upload a "reference character" (a still photo of a person or mascot) and a "reference style," and Veo 3.1 will generate a video that maintains that specific identity and aesthetic across multiple clips.</p>

            <h3>My Take</h3>
            <p>This is a massive win for corporate social media teams. Being able to maintain character consistency across vertical video clips means that brand mascots or corporate spokespeople can now be "filmed" in AI-generated settings with much higher reliability than previous versions.</p>
