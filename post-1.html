            <h2>OpenAI Sora 2 Hits 25-Second Mark and Integrated "Talkies"</h2>
            <p class="date">January 20, 2026</p>

            <p>While the Corporate AI Ledger usually focuses on text-based research, a massive update in the generative video space has implications for how we handle corporate documentation and training. OpenAI has officially rolled out <strong>Sora 2</strong>, featuring a jump to 25-second clips and integrated audio.</p>

            <h3>Key Technical Details</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extended Duration:</strong> Pro users can now generate 25-second clips, up from the previous 6–10 second limit.</li>
                <li><strong>Synchronized Audio:</strong> Sora has moved past the "silent movie" era. The model now generates high-fidelity audio and video simultaneously, including realistic lip-syncing and "environmental Foley."</li>
                <li><strong>Storyboard Tool:</strong> A new tool allows users to string these segments into a coherent narrative thread.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The "Accounting" Take</h3>
            <p>From a corporate perspective, the shift from silent clips to synchronized segments transforms AI video from a gimmick into a viable <strong>pre-visualization and training tool</strong>. For finance and compliance departments, this could eventually mean generating realistic training simulations for audit walkthroughs or internal policy explainers without the high cost of a video production team.</p>
            
            <p>The ability to sustain a scene for 25 seconds without "hallucination drift" brings us closer to a world where complex corporate procedures can be visualized instantly, though the accuracy of "financial data" within these videos will still require strict human oversight.</p>
