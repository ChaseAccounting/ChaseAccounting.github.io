# The Corporate AI Ledger

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a semester-long newsletter for **CAH 205: Applied AI** at Lindenwood University (Spring 2026). 

The newsletter, **The Corporate AI Ledger**, explores the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and the corporate financial sector. It focuses on how AI writing assistants and research tools are transforming workflows in:
* Corporate Accounting
* Finance
* Regulatory Compliance
* Professional Documentation

## Technical Specifications
This site is built as a static website hosted via **GitHub Pages**. It follows specific technical requirements to ensure compatibility with the CAH 205 News Network Dashboard:
* **Format:** Pure HTML and CSS (no Jekyll or build tools).
* **Structure:** All post files are located in the root directory.
* **Scraper Compatibility:** The `index.html` file utilizes a specific `<ul class="post-list">` structure and date formatting for automated content aggregation.
